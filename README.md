### Insights From the Report

Based on Experience level: Senior expertise is higher by counts, Senior expertise requires experience. Executive has more pay by salary compared to mid-intermediate, entry-level and senior expertise.  
    
Based on Job Title: Total job title is 93, Data Engineer, Data Scientist and Data Analyst are the top 3 job title though other job titles are also related to those 3 job titles. 
    
Based on Salary: The salary distribution is positively skewed. The company pays the employees more in USD compared to the other currency.         
    
Based on Company size: Medium Firm is higher than the other firm by 78.5%, large Firm is 15.8% while Small Firm is 5.7%.  Medium companies provide maximum onsite opportunities and minimum fully remote work.                                                                          
The company has more employees in 2023 about 44.7% than the other work year while 2022 has 43.5%. 2021 has 8.8% .  2020 has 2.9%. Decrease in 2020 maybe due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.                   
    
Experience Level by Work year:There is an increase in the number of senior expertise employed in 2023 but low intake of senior expertise in 2020, there was low intake of executive in 2020,2021,2022 and 2023.   
    
Based on Employment type: The employees are mostly full time staff. The company rarely take in contract staff, freelance staff and part-time staff  . 
There was an increase in the number of full-time staff in 2023 compared to 2020.   

Based on Employee residence: Most of the employees are domiciled in USA probably because USA have much higher wages than other countries.

Based on Remote ratio: The employee works 0% of the time or 100% of the time compared to those that work 50%. This could mean that the company are either adopting a Fully remote or On-site culture rather than a Hybrid approach.  In 2020,Employees that works fully remote are higher, same applies to 2021 this maybe due to COVID-19 pandemic changing the work trend. In 2022, Employees that works fully remote are higher BUT in 2023 employees mostly works onsite.   

Data engineers seems to have more of entry-level, mid-intermediate, executive and senior expertise than Data Scientist and Data Analyst.  Full time has more pay than contract, freelance, part-time this maybe due to their committment. The medium firm pays more salary than Large and small firms. This could be due to the fact that the large firm has more financial commitment to the other sectors owing to their large size or simply put they have more employees to pay.
    
                                                             

### RECOMMENDATIONS

Company should focus on hiring and retaining professionals in the top three job titles: Data Engineer, Data Scientist and Data Analyst. These roles seem to be in high demand and are crucial to the company's operations. Consider providing career development opportunities and competitive compensation packages to attract and retain talent in these roles.
    
Company should consider conducting a salary review to ensure fair compensation across all job levels and experience levels. Address any significant discrepancies and provide salary adjustments where necessary to promote employee satisfaction and retention.

The majority of employees work in medium-sized firms and these firms provide the most onsite opportunities. Company should consider leveraging the benefits of being a medium-sized company, such as a close-knit work environment and potential for career growth, to attract and retain employees.

Implementation of strategies to maintain a steady workforce growth.

While Full-time staff is the dominant employment type, it's important to ensure that other types of employment, such as contract, freelance and part-time staff are adequately considered when needed. Evaluation of flexibility and benefits provided to different employment types to maintain a diverse and agile workforce.

Company should consider offering additional perks, such as flexible working hours, health and wellness programs and professional development allowances, to attract and retain top talent.

Majority of the employees reside in the USA, company should consider expanding recruitment efforts to diversify the employee base.

Although company seems to have a preference for either fully remote or onsite work, it is important to consider implementing a hybrid approach that allows flexibility and accomodates employee prerferences. Conduct surveys or gather feedback to assess the feasibility and desirability of a hybrid work model within the company.




Implement initiatives to enhance employee engagement and wellbeing. This can include fostering a positive work culture, promoting work-life balance, providing mental health resourses and encouraging open communication channels within the organization.
